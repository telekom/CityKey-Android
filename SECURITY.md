# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please disclose it as a new [security issue](https://github.com/telekom/citykey-android/security/advisories/new).

This project is maintained by a dedicated team of Deutsche Telekom. As such, please give us at least 30 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
