        <p>We aim to make our app accessible without barriers. It should be designed to be in
            compliance with national legislation implementing Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the
            European Parliament. The following accessibility statement applies to the Citykey apps
            for Android and iOS.</p>
        <p><strong>Status of compatibility with respect to the requirements for barrier-free
            information technology</strong></p>
        <p>This app is currently not yet fully compatible with the requirements according to BITV.
            The accessibility of the app is undergoing constant improvements as part of our
            development process.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Non-accessible content</strong></p>
        <p><em>Contrast</em></p>
        <p>There is currently some content for which the contrast is too low. We are currently
            looking into how we can increase the contrast in line with Citykey's color scheme.</p>
        <p><em>Button size</em></p>
        <p>Some clickable objects (e.g. buttons, links) in the Android app may be a bit too small
            for users with motor weaknesses. We are currently investigating to what extent changes
            to the size are possible and useful.</p>
        <p><em>Dynamic text size in iOS</em></p>
        <p>Citykey for iOS does not support dynamic text sizes at the moment. We are currently
            planning to successively support this feature throughout the apps.</p>
        <p><strong>Creation of this accessibility statement</strong></p>
        <p>This statement was created on July 30, 2021.&nbsp;The assessment is based on
            self-assessment, with the support of accessibility testing software tools, and with the
            assistance of a visually impaired user.</p>
        <p><strong>Feedback and contact</strong></p>
        <p>We appreciate feedback on the accessibility of our app. Have you discovered any other
            barriers in our app or do you have any questions about accessibility? Then feel free to
            contact us at&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="mailto:citykey-support@telekom.de"
